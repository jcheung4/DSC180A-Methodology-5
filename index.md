**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I thought the topic of image detection was the most interesting - Given that the topic is focused on wildfire risk, maintaining power grid infrastructure and the vegetation surrounding is a primary task. However, the use of imaging technology in drones, mobile cameras, as well as vehicle mounted cameras was a very intersting insight on new data collection techniques.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For the Quarter 2 project, I would be interested in vegetation detection with respect to how it can be used to identify if vegetation has grown into the 10 foot clear radius radius required on power poles. In addition, the use of satellite imaging can be utilized for historical logging or for real-time updates. The calculations for estimated tree growth can be used to periodically check the image detection system for vegetation to more efficiently use physical resoruces in maintaining the area.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Currently, our project takes in tagged images from all 12 members of the subject domain and will use them to train a model using DETR for oject detection. A potential change I would make is to add more variation in the training data in terms of location. This may allow for more detail in the training that would allow for a better generalization. However, givne the time constraints, the feasability may not be realistic but should still produce a well-working detection model.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be interested in using more computer vision in my final project. This can be through the image detection system we train as our quarter 1 project or the vegetation detection that I am interested in pursuing for the quarter 2 project. Furthermore, the use od satellite imagery could be used for a top-down view on the specific electrical infrastructure being explored.
