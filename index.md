**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I thought the topic of image detection was the most interesting - Given that the topic is focused on wildfire risk, maintaining power grid infrastructure and the vegetation surrounding is a primary task. However, the use of imaging technology in drones, mobile cameras, as well as vehicle mounted cameras was a very intersting insight on new data collection techniques.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For the Quarter 2 project, I would be interested in vegetation detection with respect to how it can be used to identify if vegetation has grown into the 10 foot clear radius radius required on power poles. In addition, the use of satellite imaging can be utilized for historical logging or for real-time updates. The calculations for estimated tree growth can be used to periodically check the image detection system for vegetation to more efficiently use physical resoruces in maintaining the area.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
